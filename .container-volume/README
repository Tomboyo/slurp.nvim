This directory is a docker volume used to keep nvim plugin data around between
`make test` runs. It is empty when checked out from git, and becomes nonempty
after calling `make test` for the first time.

If test state seems odd, you can safely delete the untracked contents of this
directory tree and try running `make test` again.
